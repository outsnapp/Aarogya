## 9. SMS Channel: architecture & message templates

* **Architecture:**

  1. Twilio number receives inbound SMS ‚Üí Twilio calls your webhook `/sms/inbound`.
  2. Backend parses text (simple keywords) -> maps to structured symptom list -> runs same check-in logic -> stores a check-in and creates alert if necessary -> sends SMS reply to user via Twilio API.
* **Webhook endpoint (example):** `POST /sms/inbound` payload: `{ From: '+91XXXXXXXXXX', Body: 'bleeding heavy, fever' }`.
* **Parsing strategy (quick hackathon):** Lowercase body, split by commas/spaces, match keywords: `bleeding`, `heavy`, `fever`, `pain`, `urine`, `breast`.
* **SMS templates:**

  * **Welcome after opt-in:** `Aarogya: Namaste {Name}. Welcome to Aarogya. Send your daily symptoms like: "bleeding" or "fever" or "sad". For help reply HELP.`
  * **Green reply:** `Aarogya: All looks OK today. Tip: Drink warm fluids and rest. Reply CHECK to do a quick mood check.`
  * **Yellow reply:** `Aarogya: Caution ‚Äî we noticed {symptom}. Try home care: {remedy1}. Re-check in 24 hrs or reply HELP for more.`
  * **Red reply:** `Aarogya: ‚ö†Ô∏è Urgent ‚Äî we found signs of {symptom}. Please contact a doctor or nearest clinic now. If you want, reply CALL to connect to a health worker.`
* **Edge cases:** If Twilio sandbox not available, demonstrate via simulated webhook requests and pre-recorded SMS chat in the demo.

## 13. Accessibility & rural language considerations

* Use large tappable targets (>=44px). Clear labels in both Hindi and English. Use audio prompts for onboarding and check-in (TTS) as future enhancement. Use simple vocabulary; avoid medical jargon.

---

## 14. Privacy & safety notes (important for judges)

* Store minimum PII (phone + name). Encrypt phone at rest if using production DB. Provide explicit consent for SMS. Add `Reply STOP` handling for opt-out.
* Display clear `Disclaimer`: `Aarogya is not a substitute for medical care. In emergencies call local health services.`

---

## 15. Bonus features to mention (pitch)

* ASHA worker dashboard and batch monitoring.
* Voice IVR integration for fully offline/phone-only users.
* ML-based symptom classifier and localized content generation.
* Local language TTS/ASR for voice check-ins.

## 16. Appendix: Sample Twilio webhook pseudo-code (FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/sms/inbound")
async def sms_inbound(request: Request):
    form = await request.form()
    body = form.get('Body', '').lower()
    sender = form.get('From')

    # naive parser
    symptoms = []
    if 'bleed' in body or 'bleeding' in body:
        symptoms.append('bleeding')
    if 'fever' in body:
        symptoms.append('fever')
    if 'sad' in body or 'depress' in body:
        symptoms.append('low_mood')

    # run rules
    level = 'green'
    if 'bleeding' in symptoms and 'fever' in symptoms:
        level = 'red'
    elif 'bleeding' in symptoms:
        level = 'red'
    elif 'low_mood' in symptoms:
        level = 'yellow'

    resp = MessagingResponse()
    if level == 'green':
        resp.message('Aarogya: All looks OK today. Tip: Drink warm fluids and rest.')
    elif level == 'yellow':
        resp.message('Aarogya: Caution ‚Äî we noticed signs of low mood. Try breathing exercises. Reply HELP for resources.')
    else:
        resp.message('Aarogya: ‚ö†Ô∏è Urgent ‚Äî We found signs of heavy bleeding. Please contact your local clinic now.')

    return str(resp)
```

##19. Rules
Every time you run need the AI to do a big change, just do ‚ÄúRead @‚Äù[your document name]‚Äù thoroughly and follow it to address ‚Äú[your issue here]‚Äù


(This literally saved me so many hours)


1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md. Always ask questions if anything is unclear, and NEVER ASSUME.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Make sure security is tight and always production ready, no matter the cirumstance.
8. Also before coding, always have this perspective of "what would Mark Zuckerburg do in this situation"
9. After execution, please check through all the code you just wrote and make sure it follows security best practices. make sure there are no sensitive information in the front and and there are no vulnerabilities that can be exploited, and no crucial files like .env, and also before pushing to github check as well. And also please explain the functionality and code you just built out in detail. Walk me through what you changed and how it works. Act like you‚Äôre a senior engineer teaching a 16 year old how to code.
8. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md](http://todo.md/) file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
9. And also, always check for syntax errors after code completion.
10. If you need me to clarify anything, or have questions, please feel free to ask, always ensure 100% crystal clarity before execution. Further, ensure that everything I tell you to do you know how to do it, if not please state. Please do not attempt to do something you do not have information about and assume. Ask me to do research if needed.
11. Upon finishing execution, update dev.md to include any information of functions/code that we need to remove before production.
12. Check if there is any legacy code, overlapping code, overlapping functions that could cause the error
13. Small, but crucial and important changes in steps.md so in case your memory was wiped, you can always reference it
14.write the code as human like when others see the code it should look lie it is written by human not by ai but the output, logics and everything it should be high level just make it look like it is written by ai.
